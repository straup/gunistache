# NOTE: THIS IS NO LONGER NECESSARY AS OF TILESTACHE 1.6:

gunistache is a very simple CLI wrapper to run a WSGI-derived TileStache server
on top of gunicorn.

It exists only because there is still no way to pass an application-specific
config file (that is something that your code can read at runtime) to gunicorn.

It works likes this:

	$> /gunistache -w 4 -k egg:gunicorn#gevent -b localhost:8000 config.json

What happens under the hood is this:

* The example_config.json file is parsed and checked for a gunistache['name]'
  key which is used to generate a new gunicorn script/handler with code to
  render and cache map tiles using TileStache.

* The example_config.json file is the same config file/data that TileStache uses
  to know what types of tiles to generate and how to render them. The path to
  the config file is hardcoded in the new gunicorn script/handler.

* By default these new handlers are written to a directory called 'gunistache'
  in your operating system's "tmp" directory. You can override this setting by
  specifying a gunistache['app_dir'] value in the config file. For example:

	"gunistache": {
		"name": "tileserver",
		"app_dir": "."
	}

* Once that is done the code is executed by handing everything back off to
  gunicorn.

That's it. There are no ponies. Some day this code will (hopefully) be
unnecessary.
